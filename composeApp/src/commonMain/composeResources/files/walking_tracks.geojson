You can join the track either by following the Farm Track up to the track intersection, or by following the Gorge Track until it meets up. After around 30 minutes you come to a small shelter. From here the track continues up the valley to Dry Bush before heading up the eastern flank towards Lamar car

Track","status":"Open","desc":"The track starts at the end of Rapaki Road. It gradually climbs, offering pleasant views into the valley below. In the mid-section it flattens, then climbs again at a good gradient to a carpark on the Summit Rd. Take in the views of Lyttelton Harbour and the volcanic peaks and ridges of Banks Peninsula. A 10 minute walk up to the summit of Mt Vernon is well worthwhile.

Take in the views of Lyttelton Harbour and the volcanic peaks and ridges of Banks Peninsula. A 10 minute walk up to the summit of Mt Vernon is well worthwhile.

When you're ready, return the same way or link up with the Harry Ell Track or Bowenvale Valley Track to get back to Victoria Park.","InternetURL":"https://ccc.govt.nz/latters-spur-track/","RouteTraffic":"Walk","RouteWarning":"","RouteDistance":2000,"RouteHierarchy":"Primary","RouteSharedUse":"No ","RouteTravelTime":60,"RouteSegmentName":"","drvRouteDistance":"2 km","RouteLandOwnership":"CCC","RouteServiceStatus":"Open","WalkClassification":"Walking Track","drvRouteTravelTime":"1 hour ","RouteDogRestriction":"On Lead","TrackSAPEquipmentID":"IE000000000010065649","DogRestrictionStartDay":"","DogRestrictionFinishDay":"","DogRestrictionStartMonth":"","DogRestrictionFinishMonth":"","MountainBikeClassification":""}},"popup":"Latters Spur Track","_legendGroup":"Walking tracks"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[172.6459541,-43.6057543],[172.6459572,-43.6057563],[172.6459691,-43.6057639],[172.6459842,-43.6057728],[172.6460316,-43.6058228],[172.6460797,-43.6058466],[172.6461541,-43.6058819],[172.6462526,-43.6059046],[172.6463365,-43.6059487],[172.6464198,-43.6059839],[172.6464943,-43.6060142],[172.6465253,-43.6060223],[172.6465269,-43.6060227],[172.6465822,-43.6060211],[172.6466343,-43.6060133],[172.6466812,-43.6060099],[172.6468362,-43.6059444],[172.6469636,-43.6059006],[172.6469735,-43.6058971],[172.6471299,-43.6058382],[172.647132,-43.6058374],[172.6472098,-43.6058165],[172.6473193,-43.6058142],[172.6474056,-43.6058027],[172.6474073,-43.6058025],[172.6474971,-43.6058124],[172.6475563,-43.6058321],[172.6476447,-43.6058606],[172.6477314,-43.605923],[172.6478308,-43.605955],[172.647904,-43.6059814],[172.6479053,-43.6059816],[172.6479994,-43.6059958],[172.6480573,-43.6059946],[172.6481273,-43.6059709],[172.6482285,-43.6059615],[172.6483439,-43.6059654],[172.6484424,-43.6059816],[172.6485778,-43.606024],[172.6487357,-43.6060886],[172.6488537,-43.6061493],[172.6488552,-43.6061497],[172.6489272,-43.6061707],[172.6490128,-43.6061831],[172.6490293,-43.606172],[172.6490299,-43.6061358],[172.6490415,-43.6061084],[172.6490824,-43.6060666],[172.649131,-43.606044],[172.6491323,-43.6060431],[172.6491872,-43.606008],[172.6492557,-43.6059244],[172.6492913,-43.6058864],[172.6493007,-43.6058232],[172.6493101,-43.6057754],[172.649339,-43.6057024],[172.6495113,-43.6055395],[172.6495141,-43.6055369],[172.6495455,-43.6055093],[172.6495937,-43.6054335],[172.6496173,-43.6054141],[172.6501429,-43.6052833],[172.6502443,-43.605198],[172.6504294,-43.6051261],[172.6505974,-43.6050608],[172.6505983,-43.6050603],[172.6506322,-43.605039],[172.6506554,-43.6049895],[172.6506655,-43.6049205],[172.6508779,-43.6046487],[172.6510954,-43.6045567],[172.6513,-43.6044845],[172.6515691,-43.6042793],[172.651571,-43.6042776],[172.6516539,-43.6041992],[172.652123,-43.6037558],[172.6521911,-43.6037574],[172.6522337,-43.603753],[172.6522356,-43.6037528],[172.6523005,-43.6037331],[172.6523538,-43.6037168],[172.6525203,-43.603734],[172.6526901,-43.6037512],[172.6529078,-43.6037797],[172.652939,-43.6037865],[172.6529714,-43.6038036],[172.6530107,-43.6038134],[172.6530513,-43.6038144],[172.6531276,-43.6038258],[172.6532014,-43.6038617],[172.6532257,-43.6038709],[172.6533502,-43.6038964],[172.6533794,-43.6039022],[172.6534474,-43.6039026],[172.6534525,-43.6039022],[172.6535067,-43.6038989],[172.6535305,-43.6038927],[172.6535539,-43.6038767],[172.6535894,-43.6038175],[172.6535912,-43.6038151],[172.6536327,-43.6037602],[172.6536542,-43.6037474],[172.6536839,-43.6037406],[172.6537159,-43.6037401],[172.6537671,-43.6037269],[172.6538205,-43.6037219],[172.6538736,-43.6037114],[172.6539132,-43.6037068],[172.6539447,-43.6037096],[172.6539713,-43.6037198],[172.654004,-43.603733],[172.6540361,-43.6037374],[172.6540379,-43.6037375],[172.654161,-43.6037413],[172.6542108,-43.60374],[172.6542625,-43.603733],[172.6543858,-43.6037084],[172.6544346,-43.6036964],[172.6544425,-43.6036945],[172.6544662,-43.6036844],[172.6545124,-43.603682],[172.6545479,-43.6036706],[172.654562,-43.6036661],[172.6545761,-43.6036616],[172.6545785,-43.6036608],[172.6546007,-43.6036519],[172.6546178,-43.6036395],[172.6546235,-43.6036373],[172.6546441,-43.6036293],[172.6546472,-43.6036287],[172.6546503,-43.6036281],[172.6546617,-43.6036259],[172.6546631,-43.6036257],[172.6546645,-43.6036256],[172.6546875,-43.603625],[172.6546964,-43.6036241],[172.6547004,-43.6036225]]},"properties":{"feature":"walkingtracks","name":"Mitchells Track","status":"Open","desc":"Start at Dyers Pass Road, opposite the Sign of the Kiwi.

After about 10 mins, turn onto the 4WD track and head back to Taylors Mistake.","InternetURL":"https://ccc.govt.nz/godley-head-walkway/","RouteTraffic":"Walk","RouteWarning":"On road be aware of traffic","RouteDistance":7000,"RouteHierarchy":"Primary","RouteSharedUse":"No ","RouteTravelTime":180,"RouteSegmentName":"","drvRouteDistance":"7 km","RouteLandOwnership":"CCC","RouteServiceStatus":"Open","WalkClassification":"Walking Track","drvRouteTravelTime":"3 hours ","RouteDogRestriction":"On Lead","TrackSAPEquipmentID":"","DogRestrictionStartDay":"","DogRestrictionFinishDay":"","DogRestrictionStartMonth":"","DogRestrictionFinishMonth":"","MountainBikeClassification":""}},"popup":"Godley Walkway","_legendGroup":"Walking tracks"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[172.753542,-43.5871366],[172.7534805,-43.5872564],[172.7534304,-43.5873132],[172.7533876,-43.5873324],[172.7533287,-43.5873781],[172.753236,-43.587444],[172.7531717,-43.5874979],[172.7531216,-43.5875453],[172.7530983,-43.5875685],[172.7530766,-43.5876022],[172.7529813,-43.5876745],[172.7528916,-43.5877518],[172.7528493,-43.5878016],[172.7527739,-43.5878366],[172.7527186,-43.5879101],[172.7526715,-43.5879443],[172.7526498,-43.5879902],[172.7526365,-43.5880662],[172.7525522,-43.5881989],[172.7525246,-43.5882657],[172.7525058,-43.5883094],[172.7524661,-43.5883977],[172.7524187,-43.5884729],[172.75239,-43.5885548],[172.7523698,-43.5886606],[172.7523621,-43.5886955],[172.7523716,-43.5887499],[172.7523956,-43.5887862],[172.7524227,-43.5888467],[172.752428,-43.5888693],[172.7524574,-43.5889034],[172.7524936,-43.5889302],[172.7525152,-43.5889702],[172.7525368,-43.5890138],[172.7525247,-43.5890584],[172.7525256,-43.5890978],[172.7525138,-43.5891137],[172.7525069,-43.5891381],[172.7524947,-43.5891673],[172.7524915,-43.5891836],[172.7524675,-43.5891968],[172.752445,-43.5892014],[172.7524257,-43.5892206],[172.7523995,-43.5892357],[172.75234,-43.5892498],[172.7522982,-43.5892622],[172.7522698,-43.5892996],[172.7522368,-43.5893825],[172.7521961,-43.5894314],[172.7521825,-43.5894767],[172.7521274,-43.5895033],[172.7520576,-43.5895376],[172.7519975,-43.5895404],[172.7519356,-43.5895593],[172.7518018,-43.589611],[172.7516801,-43.589668],[172.7515891,-43.5897025],[172.7514959,-43.589749],[172.7513931,-43.5898373],[172.7512901,-43.5899237],[172.7512015,-43.5900102],[172.751144,-43.5900864],[172.7510529,-43.5902041],[172.7510075,-43.5902701],[172.7509785,-43.5902853],[172.7509362,-43.5903564],[172.7508989,-43.5904182],[172.7508872,-43.5904744],[172.750856,-43.5905245],[172.7508105,-43.5905828],[172.7507598,-43.5906042],[172.750685,-43.5906675],[172.7504217,-43.59086],[172.7503731,-43.5909022],[172.75033,-43.590958],[172.750298,-43.5909806],[172.7502108,-43.5910043],[172.75014,-43.5910258],[172.7501056,-43.5910526],[172.7500501,-43.5911063],[172.7499609,-43.5912169],[172.7498302,-43.5913196],[172.7496903,-43.5914163],[172.7496532,-43.5914418],[172.7495934,-43.5915232],[172.7495174,-43.5916204],[172.749444,-43.5916745],[172.7494034,-43.5917039],[172.7493301,-43.5917459],[172.7492373,-43.5918],[172.7491897,-43.59184],[172.7491536,-43.5918864],[172.7490301,-43.5919847],[172.7489539,-43.5920715],[172.748905,-43.592103],[172.748838,-43.5921844],[172.748783,-43.5922513],[172.7487512,-43.5923251],[172.7486926,-43.5924136],[172.7486794,-43.5924569],[172.7486394,-43.5924834],[172.7486131,-43.5925174],[172.7485698,-43.592555],[172.7484469,-43.5926467],[172.748363,-43.5927478],[172.7483,-43.5928004],[172.7482384,-43.5928629],[172.7482027,-43.5928778],[172.7481791,-43.5929126],[172.7481378,-43.5929515],[172.748128,-43.592965],[172.7481155,-43.5929962],[172.7480916,-43.5930256],[172.7480516,-43.5930545],[172.7480385,-43.5930688],[172.7479846,-43.5931301],[172.7479532,-43.5931697],[172.7479211,-43.5932188],[172.747899,-43.593249],[172.7478751,-43.5932992],[172.7478405,-43.593357],[172.7478107,-43.5933966],[172.7477845,-43.593425],[172.7477451,-43.5934544],[172.7476743,-43.5934865],[172.7475481,-43.5935214],[172.74748,-43.593537],[172.7473372,-43.5935812],[172.7470156,-43.5937481],[172.746842,-43.5937983],[172.7467525,-43.5938388],[172.7466836,-43.5939252],[172.7466572,-43.5939632]]},"properties":{"feature":"walkingtracks","name":"Scarborough Bluffs Track","status":"Open","desc":"The track starts from a stile on Evans Pass Rd, past the intersection with Sumnervale Dr. Zigzag up under the bluffs before coming to a junction.

It follows a number of twists and turns to link up with a 4WD track and finishes at the stand of large pine trees at the Summit Rd.","InternetURL":"https://ccc.govt.nz/eastenders-track/","RouteTraffic":"Walk","RouteWarning":"","RouteDistance":2000,"RouteHierarchy":"Primary","RouteSharedUse":"No

Follow the ridge before the track drops over onto the Lyttelton Harbour side and skirts around to Breezes Col before eventually dropping down to the Godley Head carpark.","InternetURL":"https://ccc.govt.nz/crater-rim-godley-head-to-evans-pass/","RouteTraffic":"Walk","RouteWarning":"","RouteDistance":5000,"RouteHierarchy":"Primary","RouteSharedUse":"No ","RouteTravelTime":90,"RouteSegmentName":"Evans Pass to Godley Head","drvRouteDistance":"5 km","RouteLandOwnership":"CCC","RouteServiceStatus":"Open","WalkClassification":"Walking Track","drvRouteTravelTime":"1 hour 30 minutes","RouteDogRestriction":"On Lead","TrackSAPEquipmentID":"","DogRestrictionStartDay":"","DogRestrictionFinishDay":"","DogRestrictionStartMonth":"","DogRestrictionFinishMonth":"","MountainBikeClassification":""}},"popup":"Crater Rim Walkway","_legendGroup":"Walking tracks"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[172.6734873,-43.5949092],[172.6734713,-43.5949111],[172.6734086,-43.5949011],[172.6733336,-43.5948905],[172.6732564,-43.5948886],[172.6731811,-43.5948797],[172.6731029,-43.5948723],[172.6730245,-43.5948634],[172.6729523,-43.5948521],[172.672879,-43.5948426],[172.6728019,-43.594838],[172.672731,-43.5948319],[172.672657,-43.5948247],[172.6725841,-43.5948171],[172.672507,-43.5948148],[172.6724318,-43.5948178],[172.6723572,-43.5948217],[172.6722849,-43.5948206],[172.6722342,-43.5948074],[172.6721562,-43.5947982],[172.6720822,-43.5947892],[172.6720085,-43.5947832],[172.6719365,-43.5947788],[172.6718689,-43.5947739],[172.6717994,-43.5947696],[172.6717377,-43.5947758],[172.6716734,-43.5947716],[172.6715925,-43.5947722],[172.671518,-43.5947811],[172.6714438,-43.5947879],[172.6713837,-43.5948033],[172.6713157,-43.5948197],[172.6712485,-43.5948315],[172.6711757,-43.5948386],[172.6711069,-43.5948189],[172.6710146,-43.5947925],[172.6709885,-43.5947832],[172.6708881,-43.5947531],[172.6707791,-43.5946907],[172.6707295,-43.5946694],[172.6706706,-43.5946631],[172.6705026,-43.594668],[172.6704025,-43.5947307],[172.6703886,-43.5947403],[172.6702532,-43.5947767],[172.6701946,-43.5947765],[172.6701264,-43.5947572],[172.6700906,-43.5947619],[172.6699613,-43.5947473],[172.6699054,-43.5947306],[172.669808,-43.5946972],[172.6697139,-43.5946639],[172.6696002,-43.5946399],[172.6695094,-43.59459],[172.6694282,-43.5945756],[172.669337,-43.5945895],[172.6692069,-43.5945891],[172.6691551,-43.5945488],[172.6691259,-43.5945464],[172.6690413,-43.594539],[172.6689295,-43.5945269],[172.6688593,-43.5945267],[172.6687493,-43.594533],[172.6687129,-43.594531],[172.6685795,-43.594533],[172.668459,-43.594561],[172.6683389,-43.5945347],[172.6682817,-43.5945375],[172.6682388,-43.594575],[172.6681993,-43.5945839],[172.6681743,-43.5945215],[172.6681573,-43.5944874],[172.6681661,-43.5944275],[172.6681238,-43.594354],[172.6679775,-43.5942281],[172.6678481,-43.5941428],[172.6677678,-43.5941335],[172.6676503,-43.5941606],[172.6675872,-43.5941726],[172.6674945,-43.5941936],[172.6674553,-43.5942409],[172.6674197,-43.594275],[172.6674079,-43.5942988],[172.667423,-43.5943318],[172.6674937,-43.5943859],[172.6675733,-43.5944379],[172.6675922,-43.5944587],[172.6674819,-43.5944561],[172.6674005,-43.5944552],[172.6673908,-43.5944776],[172.6674294,-43.594485],[172.6674469,-43.5944926],[172.6674362,-43.5945024],[172.6674231,-43.5945172],[172.6674344,-43.5945274],[172.6674695,-43.5945481],[172.6674994,-43.5945553],[172.6674977,-43.5945683],[172.6674712,-43.5945745],[172.6672191,-43.5945859],[172.6670979,-43.5946014],[172.6670294,-43.594609],[172.6669349,-43.5946343],[172.6668786,-43.5946357],[172.6668245,-43.5946463],[172.6668052,-43.5946643],[172.6668084,-43.5946809],[172.6668283,-43.5946922],[172.6668837,-43.5946923],[172.666929,-43.5947108],[172.6669714,-43.5947109],[172.6670511,-43.5947111],[172.6670511,-43.5947237],[172.6670175,-43.5947385],[172.666963,-43.5947597],[172.666799,-43.5947623],[172.66674,-43.5947621],[172.6667152,-43.5947681],[172.6666768,-43.594768],[172.6666187,-43.5947342],[172.6665808,-43.5947221],[172.666554,-43.5947315],[172.6665387,-43.5947522],[172.6665371,-43.5947642],[172.6665214,-43.5947822],[172.6664997,-43.5948058],[172.6664836,-43.5948256],[172.6664688,-43.5948595],[172.6664654,-43.5948985],[172.6664307,-43.594947],[172.6664242,-43.5949749],[172.6664345,-43.5949999],[172.6664215,-43.5950554],[172.6662773,-43.5952214],[172.6662766,-43.5952225]]},"properties":{"feature":"walkingtracks","name":"Crater Rim Walkway","status":"Open","desc":"From the carpark at the top of Rapaki Track, the walkway climbs steeply through tussock grassland to the top of Mt Vernon.

Bush Track","status":"Open","desc":"The track can be started at Halswell Quarry or at the end of Kennedys Bush Rd. Mostly on a wide 4WD surface, the shared use track starts with a steady climb and then flattens and descends to a gate. From the gate it's all uphill to the Summit Road. Cross the road and follow the Crater Rim a short way for views down Lyttelton Harbour. The track is mostly through private land.

Mostly on a wide 4WD surface, the shared use track starts with a steady climb and then flattens and descends to a gate. From the gate it's all uphill to the Summit Road. Cross the road and follow the Crater Rim a short way for views down Lyttelton Harbour. The track is mostly through private land. Stay on the track and be mindful that cattle can be grazing alongside it. Lambing is between August and September.","InternetURL":"https://ccc.govt.nz/kennedys-bush-track/","RouteTraffic":"Walk","RouteWarning":"","RouteDistance":3500,"RouteHierarchy":"Primary","RouteSharedUse":"Yes","RouteTravelTime":60,"RouteSegmentName":"","drvRouteDistance":"3.5

Pleasant Shared Use Track","status":"Open","desc":"The start of the track is well signposted and gradually climbs through a rolling tussock landscape to a gravel road. Take the gravel road uphill to some radio masts on the top of Mt Pleasant. A short side trip to the trig offers superb 360 degree views.

gravel road. Take the gravel road uphill to some radio masts on the top of Mt Pleasant. A short side trip to the trig offers superb 360 degree views. From the radio masts, the track follows a rocky ridge and weaves its way through tussock to end on a 4WD track near the Mt Pleasant gun emplacements. From here you can walk back the same way or continue along the Crater Rim
